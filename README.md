# COVID Vaccine Appointment Checker

    python3 check.py

Requires:

 * python3.7+
   * requests

This script is configured to check various websites for appointments in the Portland, OR metro area.
In order to use it in a different location, you need to change some of the values contained within the script,
such as the lat/long coordinates in the walgreens_checker function. That function is also configured to search for
appointments starting on April 19th, as that is when I am eligible for vaccination.
